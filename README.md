# angular-unit-test
We would show how to do unit testing for angular applications


#### Jasmine Functions
- **describe** Groups a number of related tests (this is optional, but it helps organize test code)
- **beforeEach** Executes a function before each test (this is often used for the arrange part of a test)
- **it** Executes a function to form a test (the act part of the test)
- **expect** Identifies the result from the test (part of the assert stage)
- **toEqual** Compares the result from the test to the expected value (the other part of the assert)
